The <code>--set-upstream</code> flag sets up the main branch to track the remote branch, meaning future pushes and pulls can be done without specifying the branch name and just writing <code>git push origin</code> when working on your local <code>main</code> branch. This long flag has a corresponding <code>-u</code> short flag.</p> <p>d. Back in your web browser, refresh your GitHub repository to see that the same commit you made locally has now been pushed to remote. You can use <code>git log</code> locally to see the commit ID and message which should match the ID of the most recent commit on GitHub. This is the result of pushing your changes to your remote repository.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#setting-up-the-development-environment","title":"Setting Up the Development Environment","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Step 1.
